# ParkEase (Hackathon)
Welcome to ParkEase, where we revolutionize your parking experience with cutting-edge technology. At ParkEase, we understand the frustration of endlessly circling for parking spots, which is why we're dedicated to providing a seamless solution to this common problem.

We are a team of forward-thinking individuals with a shared passion for innovation and problem-solving. Our journey began with a simple realization: traditional parking systems often lead to wasted time, increased stress, and unnecessary environmental impact. Determined to make a difference, we set out to create a solution that would streamline the parking experience for everyone.

Driven by our mission to enhance urban mobility and improve quality of life, we combined our expertise in augmented reality, mobile app development, and user experience design to develop ParkGuide. Our goal is to empower drivers with the tools they need to navigate parking effortlessly, saving time and reducing frustration.
